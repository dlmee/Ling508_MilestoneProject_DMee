<h1>Welcome to the Sense Disambiguator API</h1>
<p>Acknowledging with gratitude the help of Dr. Berry from Ling 508!</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>Generate database</h3>
<div>
  <p>NOTE: This will take a few minutes, it's doing a lot of processing under the hood.</p>
  <p>You will have to run this first, before you generate a post request. Otherwise the database will be largely empty.</p>
  <p>Currently the scrape is pointed at 'http://host.docker.internal:8000/Scrapes/GM_TPaC.html' this means you will need to have a local server running at this directory</p>
    <p>Currently this is set up as a GET request type, but this could easily be retooled as a POST to target different databases.</p>
<p>Endpoint: http://localhost:5000/generatedb</p>
