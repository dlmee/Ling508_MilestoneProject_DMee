# Ling508_MilestoneProject_DMee

## Week 3 Submission 
*Submission Notes*
I am using the readme.md file on my git repository as the document for assignment submission as well. As such the most important part of this document, currently, is the url for the git repository. [dmee/Ling508_MilestoneProject_DMee](https://github.com/dlmee/Ling508_MilestoneProject_DMee)

A few notes:
* I have updated with a Dockerfile, which builds an image and runs the container(provided that it is able to access the html file.) However, I need a little help getting the test to find the app file. I'll be reaching out for that help in just a minute. Thanks!
* There are three tests, which correspond to three classes. I am considering folding the Lemma class into the Word class, and as such have not implemented it at this time. The functionality of the Lemma class is essentially present within the Word class. 
* Some of the classes do not yet fully convey the functionality that I want. They pass tests, but as you mentioned in your recent video: I could create more rigorous tests that would require further refinement. 

Thank you!
