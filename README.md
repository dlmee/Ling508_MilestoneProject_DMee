## Week 4 Submission

Please note! Week 3 houses code that is uncluttered by implementation of the SQL database. Please reference that when scoring my week 3 benchmarks.

WOW! After a grueling day, I feel like I have finally come out on top. 

I now know how to:
-Use docker-compose up to instantiate a mySQL server.
-Access that database via DataGRIP
-Create a schema for my own database
-populate that schema with initial data
-add data in python
-delete data in python
-view data in python
-add data en masse via executemany()
-I have a better understanding of how my python code communicates with mySQL databases
-I do, however, need some help on creating the repository layer. I had to ditch that in order to get down to the brass tacks. Future things!

Please note, that I have not yet uncoupled the HTML file and the scrape. I need to come back and get all the data that I want, and not just a sample set.
