## Week 6 Submission
## PLEASE NOTE that main is now ahead of Week 6. Reference week 6 branch if necessary.

This version implements a flask api. It utilizes both a dockerfile and docker-compose.yml. First clone the database, then create a local server at the directory, which can be done in Python by putting the following in the terminal `python -m http.server
`. 

Then you may run docker-compose up. It will download all required code and then initialize the database, and finally start the api, by calling app.py. 

Once the program is running, you can go to http:/localhost:5000 to access it. Note the link there if you want to try the UI. 

On subsequent runs you will not need to run the local server, unless you need to repopulate the database. 

Thank you!
